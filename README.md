# The Innovators

This is our github repo for Fall 2020 CS 3240 Project in Django. The repo contains code related to creating a website that allows students to virtually create study groups and provide ways to meet together.

## Profile

The index of the page leads you to Google login, which you can log in with your Gmail account. You can view your profile after you log in, which you can access by clicking 'Profile' on toolbar at the top.

From the profile, you can view your name, courses you are taking, and the study group that you are joined. Courses and study groups will be blank if you didn't already enroll in course or join a study group.

The profile page allows you to enroll in course, delete the course, or create the course. Whenever you enroll in the course, you have the option to put in the coursename and rank the difficulty from 1 to 5.

## Postings

At postings section, you can create a post to let other students know that you need help. By clicking 'Create new post', the user is redirected to posting creation html where the user types the category of the post, post subject, the discord invitation link that the user wishes to use, and the content of the post.

If the user wishes to delete the post, then the user can view their own post and delete it.

## Groups

The user can create a study group that allows other user to join with same interest. If the user decides to create a group, then the user can choose the group name, the course that relates to the group, the discord link, the user's phone number and the group description. Whenever another user joins the group, the owner of the group will be notified that someone joined the study group. The groups html will also display who have joined the study group.
